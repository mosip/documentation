# Inji

In the rapidly evolving and interconnected world we live in today, ensuring widespread access to essential services such as healthcare, financial equality, global mobility, and support is of paramount importance. Central to accessing these services is the authentication of individuals' identities and the secure sharing of data to validate eligibility.
