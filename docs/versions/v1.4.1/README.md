# v1.4.1

**Release Number:** v.1.4.1&#x20;

**Release Date**: 15th July, 2024

### Overview

This release introduces new features centered on Verifiable Credentials (VC) issuance plugins related to Sunbird RC, enhances configuration capabilities for Knowledge-Based Identification (KBI), and addresses critical known issues from previous versions.

### Features

**1. Features included**

We have developed two new plugins to support the issuance of verifiable credentials (VC) by authenticating users through Knowledge-Based Identification (KBI) using the Authenticator plugin. These enhancements are detailed below:

a. [Authenticator plugin implementation for KBI with Sunbird RC.](../../overview/features/#authenticator-plugin-implementation-for-kbi-with-sunbird-rc)

* Implementation of the Authenticator plugin to enable Knowledge-Based Identification (KBI) within Sunbird RC.

b. [VC Issuance plugin implementation for Sunbird RC.](../../overview/features/#vc-issuance-plugin-implementation-for-sunbird-rc)

* Implementation of the VC Issuance plugin to facilitate the issuance of verifiable credentials within Sunbird RC.

c. [eSignet UI to support KBI form configuration](../../overview/features/#kbi-form-configuration-for-esignet-ui).

* eSignet UI now supports KBI form configuration, making it easier to set up and manage KBI-based identification.

For more information on KBI, please refer to the [KBI documentation](https://docs.esignet.io/end-user-guide/knowledge-based-authentication)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The newly developed plugins are independent and can be adapted to various use cases that utilize Knowledge-Based Identification. An example use case like Insurance Card VC Issuance demonstrates how a user can be issued a verifiable credential using the [Sunbird RC](https://github.com/mosip/digital-credential-plugins/blob/master/sunbird-rc-esignet-integration-impl/README.md) registry configured with KBI.
