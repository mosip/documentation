**Release Name**: v.1.4.0

**Release Date**: 23rd April, 2024

## Overview

Version 1.4.0 of eSignet introduces a new authentication mode and addresses known issues.

1.  **Knowledge Based Identification (KBI)**

    We are excited to share that eSignet has expanded its authentication options to include Knowledge-Based Identification (KBI) as one of its factors. With eSignet's integration capabilities, existing ID repositories storing user specific details can now be easily integrated with eSignet. This integration enables OpenID based login, allowing users to access relying party services seamlessly.
