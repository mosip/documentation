# v1.1.0

**Release Name**: eSignet

**Upgrade From**: 1.0.0

**Release Date**: 22nd September, 2023

## Overview

The 1.1.0 version of eSignet is the third release of eSignet, which mainly focuses on the **Consent Registry** feature.

The consent registry is designed to store user consent on claims and scopes requested during login to a relying party application using eSignet or the Wallet application ([Inji](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/)).

Key highlights of this feature are:

* Storage of user consent against the requested claims and scopes in the database
* If consent is already provided, the consent screen is bypassed when the user logs in using eSignet.
* Recapture consent in the event of changes in requested claims or scopes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Consent management is not applicable in this release as it solely focuses on the storage of user consent. The functionalities of editing, revoking, updating, or viewing the consent after it has been given by the user are considered beyond the scope of this release.
