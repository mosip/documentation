# Locale customization

## Steps to Support a new language

* Under `locales` folder, localization of a particular language JSON file has to be added.
* Language JSON has to be imported in `i18n.ts` and load the resources to i18next as follows. `import fil from './locales/fil.json';` `const resources = { en, fil, ar, hi, kn, ta };`
* To ensure the language needs to be included in the const `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`. `const { t } = useTranslation('common');`
* To use with react, must include the key with the 't' function `<Text>{t('editLabel')}</Text>`
