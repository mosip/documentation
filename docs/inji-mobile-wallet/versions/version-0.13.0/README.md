## **Summary**

Please find below the details for the Inji Version 0.13.0 release:

**Libraries:**

* Inji Wallet utilizes the **Secure Keystore SDK** to store keypairs, ensuring enhanced security. The SDK now includes native artifacts and is fully integrated with Inji Wallet. Additionally, the keypair generation for credential requests has been updated from RSA-4096 to RSA-2048 bits to reduce the size of the VCs.
* **Tuvali**: UUID for all the verifier services is modified to reflect the UUID service definition as per the spec. In addition, Tuvali SDK which enables offline sharing based on BLE, has native artifacts(Kotlin and Swift) now and integrated with Inji Wallet.
* With this release, Java, Kotlin, and Swift artifacts are available for the **PixelPass** library, and native artifacts are integrated into the Inji Wallet app. Additionally, the Java library facilitates QR code generation on the server side.
* The **VCI client** library handles credential requests from issuance, provided it has the accessToken, proof, and issuer metadata.

**Enhancements:**

* The issuer's well-known URL will serve as the source of truth, providing details on locale settings for fields, credential types, display properties, and order. This URL will be accessible in the \[specific location].
* With this release, the OTP flow for downloading MOSIP VC, which connects to MOSIP ID Repo, credential service and websub has been disabled. Instead, MOSIP VC can now be downloaded using the OpenID4VCI flow.

**Deployment:**

* To simplify the deployment process for Mimoto in local environment, a Docker Compose file is now available. Click [here](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-mobile-wallet/build-and-deployment/local-setup) to know more in detail.
