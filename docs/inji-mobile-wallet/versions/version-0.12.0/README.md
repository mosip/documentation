### Summary

Please find below the details for the **Inji Version 0.12.0** release:

### Features added to the Download Functionality:

#### Credential Type Selection:

Inji Wallet now allows users to select the type of credential they need, giving them the option to choose from a list of Credential Types issued by the ID provider. This enables users to download Verifiable Credentials that match their selection.&#x20;

#### VC Verification:

Inji Wallet provides the functionality to verify Verifiable Credentials using the Digital Bazaar library. The issuer's signature is verified based on the proof type provided by the issuer. Currently, we support the RSA signature type, and we will soon add support for the Ed25519 proof type.

To prevent failures during download caused by verification of Verifiable Credentials with any other signature type, this step needs to be bypassed. Learn more about the steps [**here**](../../customization-overview/credential_providers.md).

#### QR code generation for VC:

PixelPass, part of the Inji Credentialing stack, generates QR codes for Verifiable Credentials within the Inji Wallet. It's specifically designed for smaller data sets when the ID provider doesn't send a QR code along with the Verifiable Credential. Users can view and use this QR code for verification purposes by the relying party or service provider.

To know more about QR code verification, read about Inji Verify [**here**](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-mobile-wallet/components#id-5.-pixelpass).

### Library

QR Code Generation: PixelPass

### UI/UX enhancements:

Inji Mobile version 0.12.0 introduces enhanced UI to deliver a seamless user experience with an intuitive design. The UI modifications included in this release are:

**Card View UI Changes**:

* Users can now view the card in two ways:
  * A mini view on the Home Page with a quick access menu.
  * A detailed view.
* Additionally, the Settings menu has been moved to the NavBar for easier access.

**VC Share Optimization**:

* With the quick access menu in the mini view of the card:
  * Users can quickly initiate a Share or Share with Selfie action from the card to be shared.

**Activity Log enhancements:**

The audit logs have been enhanced to elevate the user experience. Now, they include the card type, along with the card number and the action performed, for better readability.

**GenderMag P2 items:**

* Enhanced text to clarify the next steps and reasons for permission requests.
* Improved user experience by providing clear notifications for success or failure, including a success screen or error banner with the reason for failure during VC sharing and face verification.

### Data backup enhancements:

As part of the 0.12.0 release, the following enhancements have been made to the Data Backup feature:

1. **Cloud as the Primary Source**:

* The backup file stored in the cloud will be the primary source of truth.
* Once the backup file is downloaded and restored, it is automatically removed from the local app storage to ensure that the latest backup file is always restored.

2. **iCloud Section Visibility**:

* The iCloud Section is now visible in the Backup & Restore settings screen, allowing users to easily manage their backup.

3. **User Notification**:

* When the user initiates a Backup or Restore process, a banner will be displayed to inform users about the ongoing process.
