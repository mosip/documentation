```
sdk install gradle 8.5
```

* To check the installed gradle version.

`gradle -V`

#### Step 4:

* Install Java JDK, refer [here](https://www.oracle.com/ph/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html).

```
[!TIP]
Restart system
```

#### Step 5:

* Install expo

```
npm install --global expo-cli
```

#### Step 6:

* Install Android SDK, refer [here](https://developer.android.com/).

#### Step 7:

* Install Node, refer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

```

or

```
wget -qO- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh> | bash
```

update the nvm version

```
nvm install 16.19.0
nvm use 16.19.0
```

#### Step 9:

Install adb

```
https://sourceforge.net/projects/quickadb/
```

Configure ANDROID\_HOME and JAVA\_HOME in system environment variables


### 2. Command to build the application

#### Step 1:

* Clone Inji repository.

#### Step 2:

* Create an `android/local.properties` file with the following data:

```
sdk.dir = <location-of-the-android-sdk>
```

* Alternatively, you can open the Android folder in the android studio. It will create `local.properties` file with `sdk.dir = <location-of-the-android-sdk>`.

> Note:
>
> * Default path for MacOS: `/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk`
> * Default path for Linux: `/home/<username>/Android/Sdk`
> * Default path for Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk`

#### Step 3:

* Inji application currently supports two themes: **orange** and **purple**.
* The default theme of the app is orange.
* To change the theme of the application, go to `.env` file and change the value of `APPLICATION_THEME` to `orange` or `purple`

#### Step 4:

*  Update mimoto url as https://api.collab.mosip.net [here](https://github.com/mosip/inji/blob/main/.env#L5)
*  Update esignet host as https://esignet.collab.mosip.net [here](https://github.com/mosip/inji/blob/main/.env#L7)
* To deploy mimoto in local refer [here](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-mobile-wallet/build-and-deployment/local-setup#how-to-run-this-setup)
  
#### Step 5:

* Go to the root folder of the project in the terminal.
* Install all the dependencies using `npm install`.

#### Step 6:

**Build and run the application on the device:**

* Run `npm run android:mosip` to build and install the application on the device.
* Run `npm run android:mosip --reset-cache` to build and install the application if any change is made in the .env file.

### 3. Troubleshooting

If you encounter the below issue on Windows,

```
**FAILURE:** Build failed with an exception.

**Where:**
  Script 'C:\....\inji\node_modules\expo\scripts\autolinking.gradle' line: 2

**What went wrong:**
  A problem occurred evaluating script.
  > Could not read script 'C:\"PATH"\inji\node_modules\expo\scripts\android\autolinking_implementation.gradle' as it does not exist.
```

* Run `npm i expo-modules-autolinking@~1.1.0` and rebuild the app
* Path for debug apk in Inji directory `android/app/build/outputs/apk/mosip/debug`

### 4. Setting Up Google API Services and Client ID for Data backup & Restore

#### Step 1:

**Creating A Google Cloud Project** Refer to this documentation on setting up a Google Cloud Project - https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project

#### Step 2:

**Enabling Google Drive APIs** Go to - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library

![GCP API Library](../../.gitbook/assets/gcp-api-libs.png)

Search for `Google drive API` and Select Google Drive API from the list.

Then enable the API.

![GCP Drive API Enable](../../.gitbook/assets/drive-api.png)

#### Step 3:

**Create Google Consent Screen**

Go to - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent

Create a new Consent Screen with necessary details such as - App Name, User Support Email, App Logo and Developer Info. Once added these details Save and Continue.

#### Step 4:

**Create Oauth Client ID**

Go to - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

![GCP Create Client ID](../../.gitbook/assets/create-CID.png)

Click on `CREATE CREDENTIALS` and choose `OAuth client ID`

![GCP Create Client ID](../../.gitbook/assets/application-type.png)

Choose Appliation type as `Android`

![GCP Create Client ID](../../.gitbook/assets/cid-details.png)

Add in details such as _Name_, _Package Name_ and _SHA- Fingerptint_

> Note:
>
> * SHA-1 should be of the keystore generated for signing the APK
> * Make sure you have checked `Custom URI Scheme` in `Advanced Settings`
> * The APK signing keystore needs to be unchanged for backup feature to work as the SHA-1 is 1-1 mapped for a client ID created

#### Step 5:

**Set Environment Variable**

Once the Client ID has been created copy the client ID and add it as part of `.env` file.

`GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID="<copied-client-id>"`

### 5. Build for PlayConsole

The Internal testing version of the build can be uploaded to `PlayConsole` for testing. PlayConsole allows the creation of internal testers group.
