# GenderMag

## What is GenderMag?

The **GenderMag Methodology** aims to analyze and mitigate gender biases in users’ problem-solving interactions with software. It underscores the importance of accounting for gender differences in human-computer interaction (HCI) during the software design process.

**Process**

1. We identified two personas based on their familiarity with technology and their ability to embrace technological progress. The personas are:
   * Abi, who is either Abigail or Abishek, is 45 years old. She works as a homemaker, is literate, but not very tech- savvy. Her internet connectivity is moderate, and she does not have a personal phone.
   * Tim, who is either Timothy or Timara, a 24-year-old financial consultant, is literate, tech-savvy, and boasts excellent internet connectivity. Additionally, he owns the latest phone.
2. Examine the feature, systematically walk through the process, assess their information handling, and pinpoint any problems.

During the walkthrough, we pinpointed inclusivity concerns in the Inji Wallet app’s user interface and experience. Subsequently, we took steps to mitigate these issues, aiming to eliminate digital entry barriers.

As part of Phase1, below P1 items are fixed in the v0.11.0-Inji Wallet release:

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Sl No</th><th>Problem statement</th><th>Solution</th><th>Jira number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><p>The term “scan” can be ambiguous because scanning a QR code within an app might result in a money transfer from a bank account. This perception could be influenced by cultural factors. Abi, instead of directly clicking on the “Scan” option, prefers to select her card and then look for a “Share” option. Unless external assistance is available, Abi will avoid using the “Scan” feature.</p><p>Without external assistance, unless there are instructions visibly posted on the wall, she might find it challenging to comprehend whether she needs to select the “scan” option.</p></td><td>The Scan Button in the Navigation Bar can now be referred to as “Share”.</td><td><p><a href="https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/INJIMOB-725">INJIMOB-725</a></p><p><a href="https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/INJIMOB-702">INJIMOB-702</a></p><p><br></p></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><p>On the "Retrieve your ID" screen, instead of using "VID auto population," consider using "Download ID."
