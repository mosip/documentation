## Summary

Please find below the details for the **Inji Version 0.11.0** release:

### VC download using KBI method

Inji Wallet has proven capability to integrate with any credential issuer supporting **OpenID** protocol and issues Verifiable Credentials (VCs) based on **OpenID4VCI** standards. To demonstrate the implementation of VC download using KBI (Knowledge Based Identification), Inji Wallet when integrated with [eSignet 1.4.0](https://docs.esignet.io/versions/v1.4.0), can connect with any issuer preferring KBI-based identification.

To know more about, KBI, refer [here](https://docs.esignet.io/end-user-guide/knowledge-based-authentication).

### Data backup and restore

Inji Wallet currently offers data backup and restore functionality using Google Drive for Android and iCloud for iOS to safely store residents' Verifiable Credentials(VCs) on resident's preferred cloud platform. This ensures security and accessibility. Resident can also easily restore backed up information as required, and thereby enabling seamless user experience whether the resident uses Android or iOS.

### GenderMag

The GenderMag Method is a process and also a set of materials helpful in investigating gender biases during resident's problem-solving experiences with software. Gendermag adheres to Human Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and thereby factor in gender differences interaction with software. As part of GenderMag walkthrough, we have identified inclusivity bugs with respect to UI / UX in Inji Wallet. Version 0.11.0 includes UI / UX changes for P1 items.
