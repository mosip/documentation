## Store Verifiable Credentials (VC):

Inji Web provides users with a secure and reliable way to store Verifiable Credentials using Durian, a highly secure data storage solution. The downloaded credential is safely stored within the platform, ensuring they have access to it whenever needed via a QR Code. This secure storage feature guarantees that credentials are protected from unauthorized access while remaining accessible for future use.

The stored credentials are available anytime, enabling users to retrieve them quickly without having to repeat the download process. Whether for personal use or to meet credential presentation requests, Inji Web ensures your VCs are always securely stored and readily available.

## Share Verifiable Credentials (VC):

Inji Web makes it easy for users to share their Verifiable Credentials with service providers or organizations. Each downloaded credential includes a QR code embedded within the PDF, offering multiple ways to share it. Users can present the QR code in person by printing the PDF or upload the file directly to a verifier's website for remote verification.

For added convenience, Inji Web supports online sharing methods where users can respond to a verifier’s presentation request, allowing seamless sharing of the VC. This flexible sharing feature empowers users to share their credentials securely and effortlessly, adapting to different verification environments.
