Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital equivalents of physical documents such as passports or licenses. They are digitally signed, ensuring they are tamper-resistant and can be instantly verified. Issued by trusted entities, VCs can be stored in digital wallet apps like Inji Wallet or downloaded as a PDF file by individuals using Inji Web, a smart web-based solution.
