# Sandbox Details

Are you a relying party looking to integrate with the Inji? Feel free to signup here. This will allow you access to our sandbox to test and integrate.

TODO: details of the collab and synergy. Also, point out the difference. collab is for the nightly build sandbox and synergy is for the released version.

Small video of how to register yourself.

As of now, we do not have the UI so can we provide the postman scripts or expose the swagger here?
