IIIT Bangalore has been home to MOSIP since its inception in 2018 and the students of the institute have been at the forefront of the MOSIP’s community-led development. The students have on an ongoing basis contributed to solving engineering problems in MOSIP for real-world applications. Their major ongoing contributions include:

**Project 1:** Synthetic IRIS Data generation using ML algorithms

MOSIP test automation suite requires large set of synthetic biometric data such as IRIS. This project attempts to generate larger set of IRIS images from the given set of sample IRIS images. The solution is built using Guided-Diffusion with pre-trained models MOSIP USSD Proxy feature enhancements.

**Project 2:** MOSIP USSD Proxy feature enhancements

MOSIP USSD Proxy is a bridge between Telco SDP and MOSIP Instance. This allows to build custom USSD workflows.

The following workflows were developed under this project:

* Check registration status for a given RID
* Retrieve UIN Lock/Unlock status
* Lock or Unlock a given UIN
