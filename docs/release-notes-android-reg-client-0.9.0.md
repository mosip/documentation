# Android Registration Client: Release Notes

**Release Name**: Android Registration Client v0.9.0

**Release version**: 0.9.0

**Support**: Support Release

**Release Date**: 26rd February, 2024

## Overview

The Android Registration Client is a tablet application designed to provide a mobile version of the existing desktop [Registration Client](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-client). It has been developed to ensure accessibility on all Android devices and was created to meet the mobility needs of countries implementing MOSIP.

The main goal of the tablet application is to simplify the registration process for residents, particularly those who are unable to visit registration centers in person. It also aims to reach remote areas where establishing registration centers is difficult. The Android Registration Client allows Operators and Supervisors to efficiently reach these remote locations and increase resident registrations nationwide.

The new features included in this release, along with those from the [Android Registration Client DP1](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/releases/release-notes-android-reg-client-dp1) release, are:

* Device Trust validation- This feature is introduced since the Android Registration Client will not accept biometrics from any non-trusted biometric application.
* Transliteration- Ability to transliterate to another language upon entering the data
* Combatibility with real SBI
* Audit 
* Operator/Supervisor Login (offline and online)
   a. Multilingual Support for display of labels (LTR)
   b. Multilingual Support for Data Entry (LTR)
