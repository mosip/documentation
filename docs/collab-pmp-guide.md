**Note**: Please fill the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMpWoX0c1yA8vAxXm1w5M3wlzXh7BC-2l2pD3O4o8coxlBtQ/viewform) to request a password modification for your account, which was initially configured following your registration on this platform.

## Pre-requisites

* Accessing the Partner Management Portal in the Collab environment is a simple process that does not require extensive setup.

* All that is needed is a username and password. If you are a new user, you can click on the `Register` option to create your credentials and register as one of our partners.

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Access the Partner Management Portal:**

Visit the following URL to access the Partner Management portal in the Collab environment: [Partner Management Portal](https://iam.collab.mosip.net/auth/realms/mosip/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=mosip-pms-client&redirect_uri=https://api.collab.mosip.net/v1/partnermanager/login-redirect/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbXAuY29sbGFiLm1vc2lwLm5ldC8=&state=b3feca86-1305-4bec-a861-c074af4bea6a&response_type=code&scope=email).

**Step 2: Login:**

* Login to the portal with a username and password.

* Get your credentials by simply registering yourself by clicking on `New user` on [PMP](https://iam.collab.mosip.net/auth/realms/mosip/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=mosip-pms-client&redirect_uri=https://api.collab.mosip.net/v1/partnermanager/login-redirect/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbXAuY29sbGFiLm1vc2lwLm5ldC8=&state=b3feca86-1305-4bec-a861-c074af4bea6a&response_type=code&scope=email#).

**Step 3: Explore the features on the Partner Management Portal**

To access all the features of the Partner Management portal and explore the partner onboarding process in MOSIP, refer to our [end user guide](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/partner-management-services/partner-management-portal).

> **Note**: We kindly request you to fill out the attached [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMpWoX0c1yA8vAxXm1w5M3wlzXh7BC-2l2pD3O4o8coxlBtQ/viewform) in order to request a password modification for your account. This is necessary as the current Partner Management Portal (PMP) in the Collab environment does not allow users to change their passwords independently. To cater to your specific requirements and security protocols, we encourage you to submit a formal request to MOSIP using this form. Our team will promptly assist you with your password customization.
