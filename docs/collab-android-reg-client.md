# Android Registration Client

**Android Registration Client (ARC)** is a tablet application that serves as portable version of the existing desktop [Registration Client](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-client). It can be accessed through Android devices and also meets mobility requirements of countries adopting MOSIP Identity.

The primary objective of the tablet version is to facilitate the registration process for residents who are not able to physically visit registration centres and also serve remote locations where setting up Registration centres is not feasible. To address this challenge, the ARC was developed enabling Operators/ Supervisors to easily access the remote areas and maximise resident registrations across the country.

Android Registration Client Demonstration Setup guide serves as a tool to demonstrate the impressive capabilities of MOSIP's system. Let's embark on this journey together to explore the potential of ARC.

## Pre-requisites ##

* Reliable and consistent Internet connectivity.

* Tablets running Android version 10 to 13.

* Tablets with a minimum of 4 GB RAM.

* The tablets should be capable of capturing fingerprints, IRIS, and face (photo) biometrics. Additionally, they should also have the ability to scan documents. However, if the tablets do not support these capabilities, MOCK SBI can be used as an alternative.

**Note**: For Mock MDS, click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14q7E5pZtfj0eimF3JGzlVfU4eV-MRPCQ) to download the Mock MDS in your system folder, which will enable you to simulate biometric capture (without real biometric devices).

* Accessing ARC in Collab environment requires the following setup:

   * UIN or a VID.

   * Upon installing ARC APK from [Collab](https://collab.mosip.net/) environment, you need to long press on the MOSIP logo to view the machine details.
