# Anroid Registration Client

**Android Registration Client (ARC)** is a tablet application that serves as portable version of the existing desktop [Registration Client](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-client). ARC can be accessed through Android devices and also meets mobility requirements of countries adopting MOSIP Identity.

The primary objective of the tablet version is to facilitate the registration process for residents who are not able to physically visit registration centres and also serve remote locations where setting up Registration centres is not feasible. To address this challenge, the ARC was developed enabling Operators / Supervisors to easily access the remote areas and maximise resident registrations across the country.

Android Registration Client Demonstration Setup guide serves as a tool to demonstrate the impressive capabilities of MOSIP's system. Let's embark on this journey together to explore the potential of ARC.
